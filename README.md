# 🚀 Power BI Project: Data Professional Survey Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview
This project serves as a technical showcase of my **Power BI** skills, focusing on transforming raw, unorganized survey data into a professional analytical dashboard. The primary goal was to master the end-to-end BI process: Data Cleaning, Modeling, and Visualization.

## 🛠️ Technical Deep Dive

### 1. Data Transformation (Table View & ETL)
One of the core challenges was handling "messy" survey data. In the **Table View**, I focused on:
* **Cleaning:** Standardizing inconsistent text entries in Job Titles and Industries.
* **Formatting:** Converting text-based salary ranges into numerical values for analysis.
* **Quality Control:** Handling null values and ensuring data integrity across 600+ records.

### 2. Key Learning Outcomes
* **DAX Implementation:** Developed custom measures for calculating weighted happiness scores.
* **Data Modeling:** Built a clean structure to support dynamic filtering by Country and Title.
* **UI/UX:** Focused on creating a clean, user-friendly interface with intuitive navigation.

## 📂 Project Files
* `Final Project.pbix`: The complete Power BI file.
* `Data/`: The raw survey dataset (CSV).

## 🚀 Quick Start
